# OrangeMoon-Frontend
Japanese Dictionary Web-App - Frontend (based on nodejs, bootstrap and angular)

# The Idea

The main goal is to implement a simple web-site which can be run on a private
web-server, which is able to provide an electronic Japanese dictionary. Another
point is to practice Japanese with it, to practice building the architecture 
and execution of then coding projects.

So this is basically a toy project which falls into multiple categories for me

* Architecture Kata
* Project Execution Kata
* Honing my Implementation Skills in different Programming Languages
* Japanese Language Learning Kata

Some of my ideas for implementation and features are already described in the 
README.md of the OrangeMoon-Backend project.

# The basic Architecture

This whole project consists of actually two projects, The OrangeMoon-Frontend 
project and the OrangeMoon-Backend project. This is the frontend project which 
needs npm, anglar and nodejs server for development, but can be compiled into 
javascript and hosted on something which is serving static files. The backend 
is quite primitive, but I don't care about it, because it is a single user 
environment - I just want it to just work. There is basically no need for scale 
or something similar. At least not yet.
